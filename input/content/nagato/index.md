This is the server I run on my local network at home. It serves as a NAS and as
a DNS server for my computers. Storage is provided by an external USB drives
bay. Since I host my media library on my NAS, I also run supporting tools on
this server to easily manage, edit, and download my media.

Nagato is a [character in the video game Azur
Lane](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Nagato)
where girls are humanized versions of warships of the same name. I didn't put
much thought in the same, I just wanted a loli character since this is fitting
for a Raspberry, a mini computer.
