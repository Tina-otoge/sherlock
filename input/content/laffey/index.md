This is my main dedicated machine. I run many apps on it such as bots, game
servers, and many of my main websites. The fact that it is hosted in Canada was
actually an oversight during purchase that I realized way too late. But in the
end I consider it an advantage because it gives me low ping with users in the
US, which I expect most of the traffic to come from.

I also rent this machine to friends to cut the costs a bit.

Laffey is a [character in the video game Azur
Lane](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Laffey)
where girls are humanized versions of warships of the same name. It was my first
character in the game, so a fitting game for what is essentially my first
"professional grade" dedicated server.
