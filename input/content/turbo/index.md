The machine I used to run apps on my local network before moving out. This is
actually running in a VM inside Free's Delta Server, an ISP provided router.

This ran the DNS server for my local network and also provided file sharing of
my NAS in a controlled and customized environment to the public Internet.
There are also some services that ran on this machine because of restrictions
that make it impossible for me to run them on my dedicated server in Canada.

Now that I moved out, this is still running but only serves as a backup for file
hosting and VPN servers in case of an emergency.

It was named "Turbo" because it is the second VM I ran on this machine, but the
previous one was starting to run slow, with this one I tried to give more
attention to performances, hence "turbo", because it's supposed to be faster.
