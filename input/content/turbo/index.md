Main machine to run apps on my local network. This is actually running in a VM
inside Free's Delta Server, an ISP provided router.

This runs the DNS server for my local network and also provides file sharing
over HTTP in a controlled and customized environment to the public Internet.
There are also some services that run on this machine because of restrictions
that make it impossible for me to run them on my dedicated server in Canada.
