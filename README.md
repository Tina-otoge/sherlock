# sherlock: Homes

Collection of homepages, since some of them share the same templates.

This is currently mainly used to generate the welcome page of the web servers on
my hobby infra.

You can read more about my infra setup there:

## Generating files

Go to the repository directory. You must be placed in the same directory as the
`input` directory. Then run:

```bash
pip install --user sssimp
python -m sssimp
```

The files have been generated to the `output` directory.
